## What's the matter ?
You wake up in a new house. There's an orange on a table in front of you. What will you do ?
It's a game where you have choices of actions to do with an orange.

## Actions
Put it in toilet ? Eat it ? Have an adventure with it ? Squish it ? Put it in the Mixer ? Stock it ? Everything is possible.
